What Is Data and Analytics? <br><br>
Data and analytics (D&A) refers to the ways organizations manage data to support all its uses, and analyze data to improve decisions, business processes and outcomes, such as discovering new business risks, challenges and opportunities.
<br><br>
        What is the role of data and analytics in business?<br><br>
The role of data and analytics is to equip businesses, their employees and leaders to make better decisions and  improve decision outcomes. This applies to all types of decisions, including macro, micro, real-time, cyclical, strategic, tactical and operational. At the same time, D&A can unearth new questions, as well as innovative solutions and opportunities that business leaders had not yet considered.
<br><br>
Progressive organizations use data in many ways and must often rely on data from outside their boundary of control for making smarter business decisions.
<br><br>
Data and analytics is also a catalyst for digital transformation as it enables faster, more accurate and more relevant decisions in complex and fast-changing business contexts.
<br><br>
Both individuals and organizational teams make decisions, for example, when a person considers whether to buy a product or service, or when a business function determines how best to serve a client or citizen.
<br><br>
Data-driven decision making means using data to work out how to improve decision making processes. This leads to the idea of a decision model, which can include prescriptive analytical techniques that generate outputs that specify which actions to take. Other analytical models are descriptive, diagnostic or predictive . Each can help with specific kinds of decisions.
